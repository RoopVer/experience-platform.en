Merkury, by Merkle, helps you recognize more digital visitors — even without cookies — so you can deliver the relevant, personalized experiences your customers demand. The person ID combines everything your organization knows about an individual – digital behaviors, buying preferences, and identifying information like a name, email address, physical address, or device ID – into one single profile.  Merkury tag, a small snippet of code that identifies anonymous site or app visits, works together with the person ID to recognize the whole person. And once you recognize the person, you can deliver personalized experiences and great service they’re expecting. All based on a deep understanding of their needs, preferences, and likely behaviors.
